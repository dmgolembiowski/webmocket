# webmocket

Heavily WIP. Initial thoughts are basically wiremock but for websockets. I'd
like matching based on paths, query params, bodies, message sequences. It's
probably going to be complicated for the crazier aspects of verifying correct
temporal behaviour with bidirectional streaming but might as well give it a
shot!
