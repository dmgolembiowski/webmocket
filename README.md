# wiremocket

'wiremocket' provides mocking so you can perform black-box testing of Rust
applications that interact with websocket APIs. It's heavily inspired by
[wiremock-rs](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/) and is an
experimentation of how it could look like in a similar API. For a relevant
wiremock issue look [here](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/113).

There's still some work to do, but this is very nearly at an initial
version!
